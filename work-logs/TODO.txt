Need to split controlled-delay into two portions. One for the uplink and one for the downlink.

In each direction, we want to maintain a target delay of 100ms. 

The uplink sender is the phone or a laptop attached to the phone over USB.

The downlink sender is the server which first needs to hole punch into the phone. 

The receiver acks back to the sender and the sender processes this ACK. 

Changes :

1. Split the uplink and the downlink into two different halves.
2. Make the receiver ack back every packet he receives. 
3. Maybe have one exec and parametrize it to be uplink or downlink ?
